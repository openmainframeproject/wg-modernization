# Defining Modernization
Modernization is about achieving continuous evolution of the business (products, services, process) in line with the company mission and customer needs. This journey is enabled by technology changes (apps, data, platforms, infrastructure, Dev & Ops tooling) and people and culture changes (organizational structure changes, culture, ways of working, alignment of priorities).  
Because of the way business, technology and people are interconnected, modernization does need to holistically look at these all perspectives to truly achieve its goals and deliver business value.

Mainframes typically support business critical operations and due to its historical criticality and longevity, not always have been through holistic or consistent approaches to modernization. A common pitfall this leads to is a biased view that the only option for modernizing capabilites that depend on mainframes, is the replacement of such platforms.  
The OMP Working Group aims to provide a clear articulation of options, principles and patterns for modernization in the mainframe context, delivering a framework that guides the modernization of technology components and organizational practices.  
This framework considers business needs, business value & ROI, execution risks & trade-offs, technology options & organizational impact. The framework is not tied to specific mainframe technologies, vendors, tools, or target states and rather focus on the approach, execution process and required capabilities.  
Because organizational context matters and "one-size fits all" approaches donâ€™t exist, the proposed framework, parameters and considerations should always be adjusted to a company reality.
