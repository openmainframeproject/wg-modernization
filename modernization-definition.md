# Defining Modernization
•	Modernization is about achieving continuous evolution of the business (products, services, process) in line with the company mission and customer needs
•	Modernization is enabled by technology changes (apps, data, platforms, infrastructure, Dev & Ops tooling) and organizational changes (structure, culture, ways of working, alignment of priorities)
•	Because of the way business, technology and organization are interconnected, modernization does need to holistically look at these all perspectives to truly achieve its goals and deliver business value


•	Mainframes typically support business critical operations and due to its historical criticality and longevity, not always have been through holistic or consistent approaches to modernization 
•	The above sometimes leads to an incorrect view that the only option for modernizing areas that depend on mainframe is the replacement of the platform 
•	The OMP Working Group aims to provide a clear articulation of options, principles and patterns for modernization in the mainframe context, delivering a framework that guides the modernization of technology components and organizational practices
•	The framework considers business needs, business value & ROI, execution risks & trade-offs, technology options & organizational impact
•	The framework is not tied to specific mainframe technologies, vendors, tools, or target states and rather focus on the approach, execution process and required capabilities
•	Because organizational context matters and "one-size fits all" approaches don’t exist, thus the framework, parameters and considerations should always be adjusted to a company reality
